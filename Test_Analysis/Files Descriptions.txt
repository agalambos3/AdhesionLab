flawdetection mono.py:
This program contains the image processing and contour detection that is used to recognize the flaw and the probe contact area
image analysis.py:
This program is outputs a histogram of the pixel values for an image. I have found it useful in thinking about image processing
autoselectroi.py:
this code autoselects the ROI for the image by (in theory removing the region of black due to the edge of the levelling table going into the image)
data_analysis.py:
This script that can be used to analyze and visualize force-displacement data collected from tensile tester. 
detectaveragesC.py:
class based implementation of intensity averaging algorithm to track contact area in videos from probe tack test
