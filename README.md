# AdhesionLab
If you are reading this document you are likely doing adhesion research with Helen! As you may know a lot of the work we do in this lab relies on code. What kinds of experiments we are running and the kinds of data analysis we are doing is always changing and evolving. Because of this the code also changes and is modified. This GitHub repository exists in order to keep track of all this code and the modifications made to it. Within this document I aim to:
1. Explain the organization of this repository
2. Explain how you might use this repository
3. Give some tips on how to get started with working on this project
4. Link additional helpful resources 

Because of the nature of this lab there is a wide range of familiarity with computer science and collaborative coding workflows. I will do my best to write this in such a way that if something does not make sense then you have enough information to google your way to an answer. If you are interested in writing code and/or modifying existing code (rather than just using existing code) and you are not familiar with Git and GitHub I suggest reading the resources below that I found helpful when learning about these things:

[Getting Started with Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)

[Getting Started with GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started)

**Disclaimer:** Although this repository was created by me, the code within has been contributed to by many people before being put into this repository. The code for the adhesion lab is a very collaborative endeavor and it has taken many peoples’ time and energy to make all of this happen.


## How is this repository organized?
On the main branch there are three folders: Levelling Table, Test Running, and Test Analysis. Each of these folders contain code corresponding to a different part of the data collection process. The Levelling Table folder contains code that enables communication between the arduino, the attached electronics, testXpert, and python scripts. The Test Running folder contains python scripts that are used to run tests. If you want to understand how to run tests using these scripts on the lab computer refer to the [Probe Tack Test S.O.P](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UmUZKZvCBH7tiiC7ttzYZqN0IUQPj35D1J8YuI-1PR8/edit) in the Research Google Drive. The Test Analysis Folder has the most files and it is the most varied. Any code that has been written to process or analyze collected data in one way or another can be found here. This folder has too much in it to describe here. 

**TODO:** create a file to describe the purpose of specific code within the Test Analysis folder.


## How can I use this repository?
GitHub repositories have countless features and ways to interact with them and it can be rather overwhelming to parse everything and to do simple things. In this section I aim to describe how you can use the repository in the context of adhesive research with Helen. I will present the two main ways I envision the repository being used and the most important things to know for each of these use cases. 
### Using the repository to run up to date code
Although writing the code contained within this repository is quite fun, the real reason all of this exists is so that we can run tests, collect data, and analyze it. The repository should contain up to date and functioning code necessary to do all of this. Because of this even if you do not intend to write any code and just want to do fun sciencey stuff you will (ideally) interact with this repository, and use it to ensure that you are running the right version of the code. 

**TODO:** flesh out this subsection in order to make it more clear what this actually means 
### Using the repository to modify and create code
If you are interested in adding and/or modifying functionality of the code then you can use this repository to make it easier to code collaboratively with others and for others to use your code to do cool new things. If you are going to use the repository in this way then it is useful to have comfort with Git and GitHub workflows. 

**TODO:** flesh out this subsection and put in more details
