# AdhesionLab
If you are reading this document you are likely doing adhesion research with Helen! As you may know a lot of the work we do in this lab relies on code. What kinds of experiments we are running and the kinds of data analysis we are doing is always changing and evolving. Because of this the code also changes and is modified. This GitHub repository exists in order to keep track of all this code and the modifications made to it. Within this document I aim to:
1. Explain the organization of this repository
2. Explain the code within this repository and its purpose
3. Give some tips on how to get started with working on this project
4. Link additional helpful resources 

Because of the nature of this lab there is a wide range of familiarity with computer science and collaborative coding workflows. I will do my best to write this in such a way that if something does not make sense then you have enough information to google your way to an answer. If you are interested in writing code and/or modifying existing code (rather than just using existing code) and you are not familiar with Git and GitHub I suggest reading the resources below that I found helpful when learning about these things:

[Getting Started with Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)

[Getting Started with GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started)

**Disclaimer:** Although this repository was created by me, the code within has been contributed to by many people before being put into this repository. The code for the adhesion lab is a very collaborative endeavor and it has taken many peoplesâ€™ time and energy to make all of this happen.


# How is this repository organized?
On the main branch there are three folders: Levelling Table, Test Running, and Test Analysis. Each of these folders contain code corresponding to a different part of the data collection process. The Levelling Table folder contains code that enables communication between the arduino, the attached electronics, testXpert, and python scripts. The Test Running folder contains python scripts that are used to run tests. If you want to understand how to run tests using these scripts on the lab computer refer to the [Probe Tack Test S.O.P](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UmUZKZvCBH7tiiC7ttzYZqN0IUQPj35D1J8YuI-1PR8/edit) in the Research Google Drive. The Test Analysis Folder has the most files and it is the most varied. Any code that has been written to process or analyze collected data in one way or another can be found here. This folder has too much in it to describe here. **Think about where to describe the purpose of code within the Test Analysis folder.**
