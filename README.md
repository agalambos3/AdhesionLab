# AdhesionLab
If you are reading this document you are likely doing adhesion research with Helen! As you may know a lot of the work we do in this lab relies on code. What kinds of experiments we are running and the kinds of data analysis we are doing is always changing and evolving. Because of this the code also changes and is modified. This GitHub repository exists in order to keep track of all this code and the modifications made to it. Within this document I aim to:
1. Explain the organization of this repository
2. Explain the code within this repository and its purpose
3. Give some tips on how to get started with working on this project
4. Link additional helpful resources
